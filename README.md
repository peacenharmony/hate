# hate

I grew up in a rural villege. Almost all homes had chickens. They grew them for egg and meat. There were no meat shops. If you want to eat chicken, you have to either use one of yours or buy from your neighbour. Cats were everybody's pets. Nobody really owned a cat. They lived like nomads. They showed up during lunch and/or dinner time. Sat next to you until you gave some food. If you don't give any food, it will divorce you and find another home.

Apart from chickens and cats, there were many other animals you deal with on a day to day basis. Most important one is a crow. They were everywhere. Domesticated dogs were not that common. Very few people had dogs, that also not as pets. They had them as guard dogs. Then there were goats, cows and few more types.

Unlike living in a city, where you see only people and transportation containers (cars, bus etc), living in a rural villege is quiet different experience. Also you get to see how those animals live together or hate each other.
